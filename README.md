# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Tool

This Python program is a Caesar cipher encryption and decryption tool. 
The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and oldest methods of encryption, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
This tool allows you to encode and decode messages using the Caesar cipher with ease.

## Introduction

The Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Tool is a Python application that provides a user-friendly interface for encoding and decoding messages using the classic Caesar cipher. 
It is a simple yet effective method of securing your messages by shifting the characters based on a user-defined shift amount.

## Features

- Encrypt plaintext messages using a specified shift amount.
- Decrypt ciphertext messages using the same shift amount.
- Support for both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Input validation to handle non-alphabetic characters.

## Instalation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   gh repo clone aFro95/Caesar-Cipher---Encrypt-Decrypt
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change your current directory to the cloned repository:
   ```sh
   cd Caesar Cipher - Encrypt & decrypt
   ```


3. **Run the Program**: Execute the Python script to start the Caesar Cipher tool:
   ```sh
   python Caesar Cipher - Encrypt & decrypt.py
   ```


## Usage

1. **Choose Encryption or Decryption**: Specify whether you want to encrypt or decrypt a message.
2. **Enter Message**: Input the plaintext message you want to encrypt or the ciphertext message you want to decrypt.
3. **Enter Shift Amount**: Specify the shift amount (key) for encryption or decryption.
4. **View Result**: The program will display the encrypted or decrypted message.
5. **Repeat or Exit**: You can choose to encrypt/decrypt another message or exit the program.
