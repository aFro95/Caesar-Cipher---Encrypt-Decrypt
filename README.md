# Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Tool

This Python program is a Caesar cipher encryption and decryption tool. 
The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and oldest methods of encryption, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.
This tool allows you to encode and decode messages using the Caesar cipher with ease.

## Introduction

The Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Tool is a Python application that provides a user-friendly interface for encoding and decoding messages using the classic Caesar cipher. 
It is a simple yet effective method of securing your messages by shifting the characters based on a user-defined shift amount.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for encoding and decoding messages.
- Supports customizable shift amounts for stronger encryption.
- Handles both encryption and decryption based on user input.
- Simple, clear, and easy-to-use Python program.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aFro95/Caesar-Cipher---Encrypt-Decrypt.git
